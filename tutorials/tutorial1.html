            This tutorial will show you how to create a github repository for the development of your game, as well as how to connect your repository to the Unity build Cloud. This will allow you to work in a project group, manage versions of your game as well as automatically build new versions of your game. Furthermore using the Unity build Cloud, it will allow you to run offline builds for any build target you choose.

              The first thing that needs to be done to allow you to use a github repository for your game is to create a git hub account. Your github account can be used for more than just this tutorial, you might even eventually want to collaborate with other gamers, so choose an account name you will be happy to live with!

            Once you have created your account you need to create a repository. A repository is the collection of all the files that will form part of your game. You can do this by selecting the New Project button on your dashboard page. You can also choose the New Repository button on the right hand side of the page, which will show if you have any existing repositories.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="section" >
            On the new repository page you need to fill in a number of details:
            <ul>
                <li> <b> Name </b> This will be name name of the repository. You can make it the same as the name of your game. </li>
                <li> <b> Description </b> You can add an optional description. </li>
                <li> <b> Public/Private </b> Select public repository. For our purposes a public repository is fine, and furthermore a private repository requires a monthly payment. </li>
                <li> <b> Initialize repository </b> Do <em>not</em> choose this option. We will be importing our Unity game files once they have been created. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Once you have created the repository you will be given a number of options to create or push a new repository. Ignore this for now, but keep the webpage open as it might be useful to refer back to later on.

            Create a new project in Unity. In the screenshot above I have named the project the same as my repository in github (this is not strictly necessary but it will help to keep you projects organised).
            The other imporant aspect of creating a new project is to note the location where you will be creating the project. This will be used later when we are using git to manage our local repository.

            Add some objects to your scene, e.g. a cube or a tree, just for testing purposes. If you downloaded the character controllers when  you installed Unity you can add those to an empty game object, just so that you can navigate around the scene.
